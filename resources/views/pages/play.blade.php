    All games and modes (/play, header concept B): every registered game
    (GameRegistry) with its cover, its modes and what a player does in it,
    in the registry's order (rule R19: the browser games first, Proof of Pong second, the own-copy games after them),
    the board games as one group where the first of them stands (PlayPage.dc.html, PlayGame.dc.html).
    The game hub links here. Public: a guest sees
    the pages anyone can open, and "Log in to play" instead of the actions
    that need an account. The links are the navigation's own
    (App\Support\Navigation\ShellNavigation), so this page never promises
    something the menus do not reach.
