    | TWENTY ONE TV: the spoken commentary (plan "KI-Stimme der Liga", P6)
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Markus Turm's voice on the 24/7 stream, generated on his own workstation
    | with VoiceStudio. Every switch here is off by default; go-live waits for
    | the user (P7 tone approval).
    |
    | scripts (App\Support\Caster\ScriptQueue, `caster:script` every minute):
    | scene scripts are written ahead per slide topic, `ahead_seconds` of
    | airtime (estimated at `words_per_second`): at most `ai_calls_per_fill` by the
    | league voice (`ai`, TV_COMMENTARY_AI; never for a topic without data),
    | the rest as `patterns` (resources/data/voice/caster.json, filled only
    | with the topic's facts), so airtime never depends on the model. A
    | script expires unused after `max_age_minutes` or when the facts of its
    | topic changed. Live moments (`live_priority`) and chat reactions
    | (`chat_priority`) jump the queue.
    |
    | fetch: the workstation fetcher (`php artisan caster:fetch`) pulls scripts
    | with `token` as a bearer token (`.env` only, never logged). A fetcher
    | seen within `online_seconds` counts as online; otherwise the stream shows
    | the script as a text lower third instead of sound.
    |
    | spool (App\Support\Caster\ClipSpool, server only): Opus clips on the
    | `disk`, hard caps `max_bytes` and `max_seconds` of unplayed audio (an
    | upload over a cap is refused with 507, the fetcher backs off), a clip is
    | deleted right after it played, unplayed clips expire with their script;
    | `caster:prune` removes expired clips and orphan files as a safety net.
    | The fetcher works towards `target_seconds` of ready audio; below
    | `filler_below_seconds` the stream plays fillers (idents, `filler: true`
    | scripts) instead of eating the last clips.
    |
    | voicestudio (workstation): the local VoiceStudio API, the voice profile
    | of each speaker and its tempo (`php artisan caster:voices` lists them),
    | pauses between chunks (seconds, slightly random), each chunk trimmed to
    | its speech with `pad_ms` of quiet at both ends. Every generation's history entry is deleted
    | right after the audio was read (the fetcher leaves no files behind).
    |
    | mix (App\Support\TwentyOne\Stream\FfmpegCommands): TV levels, voice at
    | -16 LUFS (normalised on the workstation), the music bed `music_gain_db`
    | down (to about -28 LUFS, measure with `caster:music-loudness`), ducked
    | under the voice by a sidechain compressor, limiter at -1 dBFS.
    |
    | scenes (App\Support\Caster\SceneDirector): with commentary on, a scene
    | stands at least `min_scene_seconds` and never ends before its clip ended
    | plus `tail_seconds` (never mid-sentence), at most `max_hold_seconds`.
    |
    | chat (App\Support\Caster\ChatReactions): spoken reactions to the stream
    | chat (kind 1311): a personal one only for trusted pubkeys (TrustRank >=
    | the season's minimum, or web-of-trust level 1/2 of the league's trust
    | anchors); everybody else (`everyone`) gets a generic greeting without
    | name or content, at most one per `everyone_minutes` for all of them.
    | `zaps`: every zap of the stream (kind 9735) is thanked once, with the
    | amount spelled out, the zapper's name only when trusted; zaps within
    | `zap_bundle_seconds` share one thank-you, from `zap_big_sats` on an
    | extra-emotional line. Pattern texts work with `ai` off.
    | `profiles` adds the persona card from public kind 0 + notes (cached in
    | the database, capped, pruned). Both stay off until the association has
    | decided the data protection question (profiling, GDPR).
    |
    | news (App\Support\Caster\NewsFeeds, NewsScripts; `caster:news` every 15
    | minutes): headlines from the public `feeds` (checked 2026-10-11), kept
    | `keep_hours`, at most `max_rows`; a headline about death, disaster,
    | war, terror, violence against people, abuse or suicide is never spoken
    | (keyword filter, then the model's own check). A news segment (intro,
    | the headline word for word with its source, one to three sentences of
    | opinion by the league voice, pattern reactions when it fails) at most
    | every `every_minutes`, one model call per headline.
    |
    | history (App\Support\Caster\HistoryScripts): "Markus erzählt vom
    | Bauernkrieg", a long segment built from resources/data/voice/bauernkrieg.json
    | (facts with sources, no model), every `every_minutes` (random within the
    | range), no episode again within `repeat_hours`. Segments play only on
    | calm slots, never two within `spool.segment_spacing_minutes`.
